Inverted Index / TF-IDF matrix / EuclideanLengths

Pre-requisites:
1. Linux operating system
2. Java JDK  : "1.6.0_23" 64-Bit Server
3. Hadoop 1.2.1
4. Sqoop 1.4.5
5. Tickets' records are extracted and stored in HDFS directory  "/data/helpdeskData"
6. Jar file "HDTicketRetrival.jar"


1. Execute the jar file:
hadoop jar HDTicketRetrival.jar org/greenwich/invertedIndex/InvertedIndexDriver /data/helpdeskData /data/EuclideanLengthsOutFolder


Notes: 
"/data/helpdeskData" is the input folder where the tickets' records are stored.
"/data/InvertedIndexOutFolder" is the folder that contain the inverted index.
"/data/tfidf2OutFolder" is the folder that contain the TF-IDF file.
"/data/EuclideanLengthsOutFolder" is the HDFS folder that contain EuclideanLengths
